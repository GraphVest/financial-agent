## Recommendation
Buy — Rationale: Based solely on the provided data, NVDA shows a substantial expansion in revenue (FY2025 $130,497,000,000) and net income (FY2025 $72,880,000,000), exceptional cash generation (Operating Cash Flow $64,089,000,000; Free Cash Flow $60,853,000,000), strong equity base (Total Equity $79,327,000,000) and low leverage (Debt-to-Equity 0.09101995845143275; Net Debt $1,681,000,000). These factors, taken together, support a Buy recommendation despite a trailing P/E of 45.46935492651061 and a negligible dividend yield (0.000215738094).
